# DeathRevive

Unfinished Project - not planing on finishing 

however this was a "test project" i had to do for a commissions server however i was busy so couldnt complete on time 

Breif: 
A custom death and revival system. On death of a player, the player will be stuck at the location where he died and given blindness. You can achieve this by making them ride an invisible armor stand or similar. 

The dead player must be able to be differentiated from normal players. Either a hologram on top of them, or making them sit/lie down.

The dead player will not be able to move or exit from this state. When another player right clicks on the dead player with a specified item, which can be a golden apple, the dead player is revived. They should also not be able to bypass the death state under any circumstances unless they are OP'd/have a specific permission. 

If the dead player is not revived in 1 minute, he is killed. If a player is hit while in the stuck state, he dies instantly and the timer is deleted.

We would also require a high level of configuration capabilities within this plugin.

Please code this in the latest version of Minecraft as it stands.
